I\u2019m **Vinit Shinde** from **Pune**, currently in my **final year at PICT**. This blog is a small part of my story as a developer and the journey that eventually led to the creation of the **Korus Java Framework**.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## How Everything Started\\n\\nRight after completing my 12th, I directly jumped into programming. I didn\u2019t explore multiple languages\u2014I started straight with **Java**, and that became my world.\\n\\nThe biggest influence behind my entry into programming was **my cousins**. They guided me, motivated me, and pushed me toward Java when I didn\u2019t even fully understand what programming actually was.\\n\\nLooking back, choosing Java as my first language was one of the best decisions I\u2019ve ever made.\\n\\n## Growing with Java\\n\\nAs I got deeper into the language, I began to explore:\\n\\n* Modern Java frameworks\\n* Real-world projects\\n* End-to-end development\\n* Deployment pipelines\\n\\nI still remember the moment when I built and deployed a complete project using a modern framework\u2014that\u2019s when I felt **truly confident**. That\u2019s when I realized:\\n\\n> **\\"Yes, I can build real engineering systems.\\"**\\n\\nSince then, I\u2019ve built over **50+ public GitHub repositories**, constantly improving my skills and learning everything from the ground up.\\n\\n## Why I Created Korus\\n\\nIndia has a massive developer ecosystem, especially around Java, but one thing always felt missing:\\n\\n> **We didn\u2019t have our own Java framework.**\\n\\nThat thought stayed with me. And one day, I decided:\\n\\n> \\"If something doesn\u2019t exist, I will build it myself.\\"\\n\\nThat\u2019s how **Korus** started.\\n\\nKorus is my attempt to bring something fresh, fast, and developer-friendly to the Java world, built with a strong vision and the belief that Indian developers can create world-class open-source tools.\\n\\n## Vision for the Future\\n\\nMy dream is simple:\\n\\n> **In the next 5 years, Korus should become one of the top Java frameworks in the world.**\\n\\nNot just another project\u2014but something developers love, trust, and use confidently.\\n\\nThis is just the beginning.\\n\\n## Final Words\\n\\nIf you\'re reading this:\\n\\n* Start early\\n* Learn consistently\\n* Build fearlessly\\n\\nYou don\u2019t need a perfect background or perfect conditions. You just need passion, discipline, and the courage to start.\\n\\nThank you for reading. This journey has shaped me as a developer, and Korus is the biggest step of that journey. The best part is still ahead."},{"id":"korus-vs-spring-micronaut-quarkus","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/korus-vs-spring-micronaut-quarkus","editUrl":"https://github.com/korus-projects/korus-projects.github.io/tree/main/blog/2025-12-03-korus-vs-others.md","source":"@site/blog/2025-12-03-korus-vs-others.md","title":"Korus vs Spring Boot vs Micronaut vs Quarkus","description":"A practical comparison of modern Java frameworks \u2014 startup time, memory, DI model, and architecture.","date":"2025-12-03T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"korus","permalink":"/blog/tags/korus"},{"inline":true,"label":"java","permalink":"/blog/tags/java"},{"inline":true,"label":"comparison","permalink":"/blog/tags/comparison"},{"inline":true,"label":"quarkus","permalink":"/blog/tags/quarkus"},{"inline":true,"label":"spring","permalink":"/blog/tags/spring"},{"inline":true,"label":"micronaut","permalink":"/blog/tags/micronaut"}],"readingTime":0.82,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Vinit Shinde","title":"Creator of Korus Framework","url":"https://github.com/Vin-it-9","socials":{"github":"https://github.com/Vin-it-9","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/vinit-shinde-920531254/"},"imageURL":"https://github.com/Vin-it-9.png","key":"vinit","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"korus-vs-spring-micronaut-quarkus","title":"Korus vs Spring Boot vs Micronaut vs Quarkus","description":"A practical comparison of modern Java frameworks \u2014 startup time, memory, DI model, and architecture.","authors":["vinit"],"tags":["korus","java","comparison","quarkus","spring","micronaut"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"My Journey into Java and the Story Behind Korus","permalink":"/blog/my-journey-into-java-and-korus"},"nextItem":{"title":"Build-Time Dependency Injection Explained","permalink":"/blog/build-time-dependency-injection-explained"}},"content":"Let\u2019s compare the most popular modern Java frameworks.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Startup Time Comparison\\n\\n| Framework | Startup Time |\\n|----------|--------------|\\n| Spring Boot | 1500\u20132500ms |\\n| Micronaut | 600\u20131200ms |\\n| Quarkus | 800\u20131500ms |\\n| **Korus** | **120\u2013250ms** |\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Dependency Injection Model\\n\\n| Framework | DI Style          | Reflection?

Korus eliminates all of them by generating:\\n\\n- Dependency wiring\\n- DI registries\\n- Routing metadata\\n- Bootstrapping code\\n\\n**during compilation**, not at runtime.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nThe result:\\n\\n- **120\u2013250 ms startup time**\\n- **~50 MB memory footprint**\\n- **Zero reflection**\\n- **Deterministic, safe DI graph**\\n- **Lightweight Undertow runtime**\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Why I Built Korus\\n\\nWhile working with Spring Boot and Micronaut, I noticed a common issue:\\n\\n> *Even build-time DI frameworks keep some runtime magic.*\\n\\nSome still rely on reflection, some use proxies, some still scan packages.  \\nThis inspired the architecture of Korus:\\n\\n- Pure annotation processing\\n- Pure compile-time registry generation\\n- No runtime analysis\\n- No surprises\\n\\nKorus aims to bring:\\n\\n- The **developer experience of Spring**\\n- The **performance of Quarkus/Micronaut**\\n- And a **clean, minimal runtime**\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Architecture Overview\\n\\nKorus consists of **two independent modules**:\\n\\n### **1. Korus Processor (Build-Time Engine)**\\nResponsible for:\\n\\n- Scanning source code\\n- Building the DI graph\\n- Performing Jandex indexing\\n- Generating wiring and route registries\\n- Auto-generating `KorusMain`\\n\\n### **2. Korus Framework (Runtime Engine)**\\nA lightweight Undertow-based runtime that:\\n\\n- Loads pre-generated classes instantly\\n- Does not use reflection\\n- Does not scan the classpath\\n- Boots in under **0.25 seconds**\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Where We Are Today\\n\\n- 20,000+ lines of Java code\\n- Two-module architecture\\n- Stable build-time DI engine\\n- Fast Jandex-based lookup\\n- Hibernate + HikariCP integration\\n\\n---\\n\\n## What\u2019s Next?\\n\\n- Multi-module architecture (Core, Web, Data)\\n- Korus CLI (\u201ckorus new app\u201d)\\n- Simpler configuration API\\n- New Data access module\\n- Build-time validation improvements\\n\\n---\\n\\nKorus is now open to the Java community.  \\nI built it to solve real problems, and I\u2019m excited to see what developers create with it.\\n\\n\ud83d\udc49 GitHub: **https://github.com/korus-projects/**"}]}}')}}]);
