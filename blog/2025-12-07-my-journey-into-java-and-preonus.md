# My Journey into Java and the Story Behind Preonus

Hello everyone! I’m **Vinit Shinde** from **Pune**, currently in my **final year at PICT**. This blog is a small part of my story as a developer and the journey that eventually led to the creation of the **Preonus Java Framework**.

## How Everything Started

Right after completing my 12th, I directly jumped into programming. I didn’t explore multiple languages—I started straight with **Java**, and that became my world.

The biggest influence behind my entry into programming was **my cousins**. They guided me, motivated me, and pushed me toward Java when I didn’t even fully understand what programming actually was.

Looking back, choosing Java as my first language was one of the best decisions I’ve ever made.

## Growing with Java

As I got deeper into the language, I began to explore:

* Modern Java frameworks
* Real-world projects
* End-to-end development
* Deployment pipelines

I still remember the moment when I built and deployed a complete project using a modern framework—that’s when I felt **truly confident**. That’s when I realized:

> **"Yes, I can build real engineering systems."**

Since then, I’ve built over **50+ public GitHub repositories**, constantly improving my skills and learning everything from the ground up.

## Why I Created Preonus

India has a massive developer ecosystem, especially around Java, but one thing always felt missing:

> **We didn’t have our own Java framework.**

That thought stayed with me. And one day, I decided:

> "If something doesn’t exist, I will build it myself."

That’s how **Preonus** started.

Preonus is my attempt to bring something fresh, fast, and developer-friendly to the Java world, built with a strong vision and the belief that Indian developers can create world-class open-source tools.

## Vision for the Future

My dream is simple:

> **In the next 5 years, Preonus should become one of the top Java frameworks in the world.**

Not just another project—but something developers love, trust, and use confidently.

This is just the beginning.

## Final Words

If you're reading this:

* Start early
* Learn consistently
* Build fearlessly

You don’t need a perfect background or perfect conditions. You just need passion, discipline, and the courage to start.

Thank you for reading. This journey has shaped me as a developer, and Preonus is the biggest step of that journey. The best part is still ahead.
