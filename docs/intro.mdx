# Introduction to Korus Framework

Korus Framework is a Build-Time Dependency Injection framework designed for **ultra-fast Java applications**.
It removes reflection, classpath scanning, and runtime dependency wiring entirely — delivering performance comparable to Quarkus and Micronaut while preserving a clean, Spring-like developer experience.

## What is Korus?

Korus is a modern Java framework built around **annotation processing**, **compile-time bean creation**, and a **lightweight runtime**.
All routing, dependency wiring, configuration metadata, and validation logic is generated **during compilation**, not at runtime.

:::tip Key Benefits
- **Zero Reflection** - No runtime introspection overhead
- **Zero Classpath Scanning** - Everything resolved at compile time
- **Zero Dynamic Proxies** - Direct method calls only
- **Instant Startup Times** - Applications start in milliseconds
- **Low Memory Footprint** - Minimal runtime overhead

### **Korus Processor**

Responsible for:
- Annotation scanning & model building
- Generating bean wiring at compile time
- Creating DI registries
- Performing circular dependency detection
- Generating route metadata
- Jandex-based indexing for fast lookups
- Auto-generating a `KorusMain` boot class

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="runtime" label="Runtime Engine">

### **Korus Framework**

A lightweight runtime that:
- Loads pre-generated classes instantly
- Does not perform any reflection
- Does not scan classpath packages
- Uses static indexes + generated registries
- Boots in ~0.10s – 0.20s

## Build-Time Dependency Injection

Korus generates concrete bean classes and wiring logic **during compilation**:

- Direct constructor/method injection written into generated Java files
- Deterministic topological sort for bean initialization
- Compile-time detection of circular dependencies
- Complete removal of runtime scanning and proxies

This gives Korus its signature performance benefits.
